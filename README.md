## What is this?

Twitter has recently launched [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/), a toolkit designed to kickstart development of webapps and sites. Bootstrap includes base CSS and HTML for typography, forms, buttons, tables, grids, navigation, and more. It gives you a lot of functionality and design for free, but getting used to new syntax is always a bit of an issue.

This is where this bundle comes in. Clone it to your computer, install it on your Textmate (by double clicking the bundle) and you'll be on your way to starting using Bootstrap much faster than you normally would. All snippet commands in this bundle start with `tt` (for Twitter, basically).
